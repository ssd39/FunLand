**Fun Land = Fun + Metaverse**

## Brainstorm 🧠

We all have used various meet and greet apps. The one thing they lack is interactivity and Preservation of memories. Memories are important and So is having fun. We wanted to build something that will capture the attention of Gen-Z while also maintaining the ease of usage. Everyone likes competing in a healthy and fun way. Games can make ice-breaking with new people. Everyone can now easily record their gameplay (thanks to **Loom**) that makes it more interactive users can comment on their friend’s gameplay and have a laugh.

## What it does 🔧

The current demand for virtual meetings and events are increasing and the traditional meeting/event environment and apps  no longer enough to give a fully immersive experience. So we have created a 3D space where users can host there event and meetings in a single click and experience a fun filled immersive experience with there friends and family. 

- Create Events/Meeting Links 
- Record their Gameplay
- Comment on each others gameplay
- Play among the various games provided
- Add new games in a single click
- Spatial Audio to improve the experience 
- Share Screen during Event/Meeting 
- Video on Character for realistic feel

## Challenges we ran into 💪

- Instead of Using Game-Engines which do not support web-browsers natively we have used **BablyonJs** for the best possible user Experience
- Porting the **loom embedded player** to the 3D world.

## What's next for FunLand⏱

There’s a lot to build and a lot to learn. We want to work on growing the project organically. We want to create and add more multiplayer games. Adding other activities for enjoyment beside games.
